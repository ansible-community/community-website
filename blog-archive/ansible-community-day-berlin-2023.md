# Ansible Community Day, Berlin 2023

![Ansible community day logo](/images/posts/archive/community-day-berliin-20230824.png) 

The Ansible Community Day is a new initiative by the Ansible Community
Team at Red Hat to connect with the people using, contributing to, and
developing the Ansible project worldwide. This new event complements the
Ansible Contributor Summit, to put the users of Ansible in all their
shapes and forms front and center.

In the last Ansible Community Day in Boston, the day right before
AnsibleFest 2023, the community had the opportunity to meet in-person
and get to know each other, learn a few things and share their knowledge
using Ansible. It was such a great experience that we couldn't wait to
have another. And here it is!

## Guten Tag Berlin!

After two very successful Ansible Community Day events this year, the
first in Pune, India in February and the next in Boston in May, our
third event for 2023 will be held in Berlin, Germany!

Registration for Ansible Community Day Berlin 2023 is now open! If you'd
like to attend, please check out the following
[Eventbrite page for specific details and registration.](https://ansible-community-day-berlin-2023.eventbrite.com/) 

The event is set for Wednesday, September 20, 2023.
We will meet in c-base (Rungestraße 20, Berlin, Germany)

What can you expect from (or bring to!) the upcoming Ansible Community Day?

-   Ansible community recap of previous announcements, status and
    what's new!
-   User stories: Sharing of achievements and challenges using Ansible
-   Live (and recorded) demos: It's showtime! 
-   Ansible Content Collections: how to create, contribute or use them
    to automate everything!
-   Better together: Integrating Ansible with other tools or platforms
    (e.g. Kubernetes, Terraform, Dynatrace, Grafana, Jenkins, etc.)
-   Learn about the Ansible ecosystem (e.g. AWX, devtools, Event-Driven
    Ansible) and how you can contribute to these open source projects to
    jumpstart your career
-   And last but not least: community networking!

If any of those above caught your attention and you are thinking "I
could talk about that", check the **Call for Proposals** below!

## Call for Proposals (CFP)

We are looking for speakers!

If you have something to share with the Ansible community of users and
contributors, you can [submit your proposal](https://www.papercall.io/ansible-community-day-berlin-2023)
before September 4 at 23:59 (UTC).

Presentations don't need to be ready upon submission, we are only
requesting a title and abstract at this time. Any of the topics above
are valid submissions, but that's not an exhaustive list. Feel free to
submit any idea or proposal involving Ansible, and we will let you know
if it works for the current event.

Have questions? Doubts? You can reach out to us in our [Social Room](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com)
(`#social:ansible.com`) in the Ansible Matrix space or email the Ansible Community Team at
<a href="mailto:ansible-community@redhat.com">ansible-community@redhat.com</a>.
