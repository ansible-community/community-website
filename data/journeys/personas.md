# Ansible community personas

Personas represent various humans who are all on different journeys within the Ansible community. These personas help put community users, or members, in context to identify what content they need at each stage of their respective journeys.

We use personas to ensure Ansible community users can find help when and where they need it. If the right support is there, users are much more likely to succeed with their goals. This leads to higher levels of adoption and a more vibrant, stronger community.

The practical goal of defining these personas is to improve the navigation and layout of the Ansible community website.

We use single words for the persona names, so that they are easy to refer to in code/documentation/etc internally. Explanations of the words are given underneath.

## Novice

The word novice is not implied to mean someone unskilled, but rather someone new to Ansible who is looking for general information.

I'm a general technologist who's interested in automation, or has heard about Ansible in some way. I've landed here after a search and want guidance to my next steps.

* **Needs:** Clear information about where they have landed. Clear direction to next steps (docs, forum, chat, install method)
* **Attitude:** Curious, in learning mode. Will tolerate having to hunt a little, but *only* a little.
* **Knowledge:** Generally capable with tech, familiar with other project sites. Expects similar layout/navigation to get what they need.

## Contributor

Here contributor also includes *potential* contributors - in any case, people looking to get more deeply involved with the project

I'm already an Ansible user and I'm looking to connect with the project, or I'm already part of the Ansible community and looking to participate in a new area.

* **Needs:** Information on what places exist for connection/participation (bullhorn, forum, chat rooms, upcoming meetings & events)
* **Attitude:** Excited / enthusiastic. Wants to contribute, but may back down if there are blockers or lack of information
* **Knowledge:** Understands Ansible, *may* understand open source contribution in general. In the case of existing members, probably knows the project structure somewhat, but not the specifics of where to find people on another sub-project.

## Customer

Here we are talking about "Enterprise decision makers". With the name "Ansible" being overloaded, there is high chance that a user will end up on the community site even though they are looking for product information. In addition, we should be clear about our relationship with Red Hat as our primary sponsor - these can be combined together.

I'm looking for information on Red Hat's Ansible offerings. I might be an exiting customer looking for specific detail, or a new customer looking to learn more about the product line

* **Needs:** Clear direction to the product pages, one click away.
* **Attitude:** Possibly irritated that they didn't land on the product right away. Might appreciate being aware of the upstream community, but wants to get to their target.
* **Knowledge:** Unclear, but business-focussed for sure. Might be aware of RHAAP, AutomationHub, etc, or might be a community user of Ansible looking to go further

## Meetup organizer

Meetup organizers plan, organize, and coordinate events around Ansible. These events can range from casual meetups for hobbists to full-scale conferences.

* **Needs:** An understanding of what consistutes an Ansible meetup, how to abide by the code of conduct, and resources for successfully hosting an Ansible event.
* **Attitude:** Motivated to have a successful event, which can often be quite stressful. Meetups can be time-consuming and require a lot of preparation.
* **Knowledge:** Undetermined, meetup organizers might not have technical backgrounds or be very experienced with Ansible.
