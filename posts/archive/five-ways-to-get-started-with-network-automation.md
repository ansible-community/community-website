# Five ways to get started with network automation

As many of you know, Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is a highly
flexible IT automation platform that can automate your Linux and Windows
instances, your VMware private cloud, your AWS, Azure or Google public
cloud, and even your security infrastructure.  Today I want to write
about one of my favorite use-cases; using Ansible Automation Platform
for network automation. It provides easy, highly customizable automation
for your routers and switches so you can automate them just like any
other IT infrastructure.

However, even though network automation has become increasingly popular,
most organizations are still managing their network infrastructure
manually by a CLI or GUI. Why is this? This manual CLI work often means
that network engineers are reactive and constantly drowning with
break-fix network issues because of manual mis-configurations, or the
inability to implement change quickly and efficiently.

Because network engineers are so busy firefighting in their day job,
they don't have time to look at a new activity like automating, even
though automation will save them time and money in the long run. I
fundamentally believe that network automation is not an all or nothing
situation.  You need to adopt network automation in small increments so
you can earn yourself, and your team more time.  In other words, start
small and think big. I put together this [video to help network
engineers brainstorm five great use cases for network
automation](https://youtu.be/wXUgYfZKMHU). This list is not exhaustive;
there are many more use-cases that you can do with network automation,
but this is meant to give network administrators an idea of what is
possible.

If you're looking to learn more about a specific use-case, you can jump
right to it:
