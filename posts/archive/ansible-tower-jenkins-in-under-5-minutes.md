# Connect Ansible Tower and Jenkins in under 5 minutes

We often hear from customers that they are using Jenkins in some
capacity or another. And since I\'m a consultant, I\'m lucky to hear
first hand what our customers are using and how they need to integrate
Ansible Tower. There has always been a way to integrate the Ansible
Tower and Jenkins using
[tower-cli](https://github.com/ansible/tower-cli), but
I thought there could be a neater, closer to native, way of doing it.

So here we go. I've recorded this short screencast to show you just how easy it is:

<script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>
</p>
<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
  <div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;">
    <div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_losl1x4e3a videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;width:100%">
      &nbsp;
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Below you will find a few links from the video and a link to how to try
Ansible Tower.
