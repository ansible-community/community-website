# AnsibleFest 2021 Network Automation Track

This year, we are adapting our signature automation event, AnsibleFest,
into a free virtual experience to connect our communities with a wider
audience and to collaborate to solve problems. Seasoned pros and new
Ansible enthusiasts alike can find answers and learn more about Red Hat
Ansible Automation Platform, the platform for building and operating
automation at scale and creating an enterprise automation strategy. Have
you already automated some type of server or infrastructure management?
Use the [network automation track](https://events.ansiblefest.redhat.com/widget/redhat/ansible21/sessioncatalog?search.track=1623965164845001BE2L)
to understand the benefits that come with automating network management
the Ansible way. 

Let's take a closer look at this track for [AnsibleFest 2021](http://ansiblefest.com){rel="noopener"}.

## Network Automation at AnsibleFest

Gone are the days of hand-typing commands into network devices one by
one, because you simply can't keep up. Manage your network
infrastructure using Ansible Automation Platform throughout the entire
development and production life cycle, and free time as a result to
focus on your top priority network engineering challenges. This
AnsibleFest track focuses on network automation topics for **automation content developers** as well as
**network and cloud engineers or operators**. 

Attendees will learn how network automation can no longer be a point
tool, but instead part of a holistic automation strategy that spans
NetOps and even IT teams. You will hear about some key use cases in
network automation, as well as a new builder experience that makes it
easier to create great network automation so your team can move
faster.  

You'll hear from our customers who will share their experiences, as well
as our network partners who will explain how to automate their solutions
using Ansible Automation Platform. We also suggest you take a look at
the Telco track, which features additional customers and advanced topics
like AIOps.  

Here are a few sessions that you can expect to see in the network
automation track: 

-   Journey to Network Automation (great for getting started) by Sean
    Cavanaugh and Trishna Guha 
-   NetDevOps: The network developer automation experience by Brad
